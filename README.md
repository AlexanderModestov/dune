## üìà Metric Calculations

### **borrow_amount_usd**
Cumulative borrowed amount in USD, calculated using window functions to track total borrowing over time. Includes:
- ‚úÖ Positive amounts from borrow events
- ‚ùå Negative amounts from repayments and liquidations  
- ‚ûï Interest accrual

### **supply_amount_usd**
Cumulative supplied amount in USD, incorporating:
- ‚úÖ Supply events (positive)
- ‚ùå Withdrawals (negative)
- ‚ùå Bad debt from liquidations (negative)
- ‚ûï Earned interest (positive)

### **tvl_amount_usd**
Total Value Locked representing the sum of supplied assets and collateral deposits, providing a comprehensive view of vault asset holdings.

### **pure_tvl_amount_usd**
Pure TVL calculation that subtracts borrowed amounts from total value locked, showing the net asset position of the vault.

### **ratio**
Pure TVL to Supply ratio, indicating the efficiency of capital utilization and the proportion of assets actively generating yield versus borrowed funds.

## üßÆ Calculation Methodology

### **Supply Interactions**
```
Supply Events: + amounts from supply operations
Withdraw Events: - amounts from withdrawal operations  
Liquidation Bad Debt: - amounts from bad debt socialization
Interest Accrual: + amounts from interest earned
```

### **Borrow Interactions**
```
Borrow Events: + amounts from borrowing operations
Repay Events: - amounts from repayment operations
Liquidation Repaid: - amounts from liquidation repayments
Interest Accrual: + amounts from interest charged
```

### **Collateral Interactions**
```
Supply Collateral: + amounts from collateral deposits
Withdraw Collateral: - amounts from collateral withdrawals
Liquidation Seized: - amounts from seized collateral
```

## üìä Final Output Metrics

### **Cumulative Calculations**
All metrics use window functions for cumulative tracking:

| Metric | Formula |
|--------|---------|
| `borrow_amount_usd` | `SUM(borrow_amount) OVER (ORDER BY day)` |
| `supply_amount_usd` | `SUM(supply_amount) OVER (ORDER BY day)` |
| `tvl_amount_usd` | `SUM(supply_amount) + SUM(collateral_amount) OVER (ORDER BY day)` |
| `pure_tvl_amount_usd` | `SUM(supply_amount) + SUM(collateral_amount) - SUM(borrow_amount) OVER (ORDER BY day)` |
| `ratio` | `pure_tvl_amount / supply_amount` |
